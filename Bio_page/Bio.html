        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="description-jf">Hi, I'm Juan Figueroa, a Software Application Development Apprentice at HP based in Houston, TX. 
            My journey into the world of programming began with a curiosity sparked by YouTube tutorials and online courses.
            I started my career in Data, developing strong analytical and problem-solving skills. However, my passion for programming led me to transition into software development.
            Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, trying new cuisines, working out and spending time with my dog Milo.
